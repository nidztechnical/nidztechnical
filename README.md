I'm Nidhi from India, and I do full stack development, Data Science and Automation projects. I really enjoy learning languages like Python, JavaScript, React and React Native, as well as work on Django, Spring Boot.
I enjoy working on Data Visualisation tools Tableau, Power BI and Grafana. I also enjoy wireframing, UI, UX, and design in general. You can check out my LinkedIn account at https://www.linkedin.com/in/nidhu12
